Last week I took a technical challenge on HackerRank. One of the assignments was not like the others.
Usually I get to solve algorithms , like brackets, skyline, two sum and etc.
But this time they asked me to add functionality to VanillaJS MVC ToDo app.

The properly working app can be found here http://todomvc.com/examples/vanillajs/

I am taking a chance to dive into the code of the app as I have another couple of months before HackReactor.

There is a set of JavaScript files being loaded. I am my journey with the first one.
The logic being that later files rely on what has been loaded earlier.

Base.js:

It's an immediately invoked function. A lot of RegEx stuff. Looks like it is for parsing something.
From my understanding this does not influence the functionality of the app. Commenting the script proves it.
It implements a set of underscore library methods and other functions to display a block in left-upper side
when the app is launched on their homepage.

We skip it.

Helper.js

On the first look it is an implementation of jQuery functionality: select element, add listener, and delegate.
A couple of neat elegant tricks:
Recursion in search of a parent element
Copying array's forEach method to DOM NodeList, which allows to implement event delegation.

Store.js

This file defines the local storage and its methods. A store is not created here though.

Things I have learned:

!! - casting to boolean
