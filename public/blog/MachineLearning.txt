Started Machine Learning Course on Coursera.

It is taught by a Stanford professor. So far so good.

He starts with explanations what kind of machine learning technologies exist.
There are tow major approaches: supervised and unspervised.
The difference is that the first one knows exactly what the categories are.
The second one defines commonalities among different cases of a dataset and
decides how to claster them.

Day 2

Remembered about how to derive the derivative function.

In order to find the linear function to represent the approximation for the given data
we should start with giving the Thetas initial values. It doesn't matter where to start.
Later steps will adjust the values as they are being applied to the dataset.
The purpose is to minimize the function of differences between the hypothesis and
the real data. The derivative of the quadratic difference shows which side to go
to achieve local minimum.
