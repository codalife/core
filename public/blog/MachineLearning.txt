Started Machine Learning Course on Coursera.

It is taught by a Stanford professor. So far so good.

He starts with explanations what kind of machine learning technologies exist.
There are tow major approaches: supervised and unspervised.
The difference is that the first one knows exactly what the categories are.
The second one defines commonalities among different cases of a dataset and
decides how to claster them.
